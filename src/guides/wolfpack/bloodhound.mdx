# Bloodhound

The Bloodhound is a powerful tactical addition to the Wolfpack. They are
equivalent to the Seer for the Werewolves, and their ability is even
more powerful than the Seer's is.

## Role Type

  - The Bloodhound is seen as a member of the Wolfpack by the Seer.
  - The Bloodhound is not seen as a user of witchcraft.
  - The Bloodhound is seen visiting by the Harlot/Stalker/Familiar.
  - The Bloodhound is seen as a killer by the Adjudicator.

## Notes

  - Each night, the Bloodhound can reveal the exact identity of another
    member of the village (whereas the Seer can only know a player's
    alignment).
  - The Bloodhound does not attack their target and therefore does not
    trigger abilities like that of the Huntsman or Shaman.
  - If there are no killing wolves left in the Wolfpack, the Bloodhound
    will become a normal Werewolf. The Bloodhound is the first to
    revert, before a Bloodletter or Direwolf would.

## Tips for playing Bloodhound

  - For some general tips on how to play as a member of the Wolfpack,
    look at the corresponding section in the 'Factions' page.
  - Do not make the mistake of pretending to be Seer and then reporting
    to the Village the exact identities of other players\! For example,
    you should say, "So-and-so is village" rather than "So-and-so is the
    gravedigger" since the seer would only know alignment rather than
    specific role.
  - The Wolfpack can decide to have the Bloodhound check who they kill,
    or not. If they check who they kill they can be sure which roles are
    out of the game, and they have all the information needed to pretend
    to be a Gravedigger. If the Bloodhound chooses other targets than
    the killing wolves, the Wolfpack increases the speed with which they
    can detect and kill important roles.
  - Sometimes, the Bloodhound's findings can influence the Wolfpack's
    actions the following day (what to say, which role to claim, etc).
    For these situations the Bloodhound can agree on a code with the
    Wolfpack in which they secretly transmit their findings in the
    village chat. This is also helpful because the Bloodhound may be
    lynched that day, and thus cannot share their information at night
    anymore\! Note: the Bloodhound code does not involve external sites
    or the use of cryptography (see the Rules section). The code only
    involves the use of specific words/sentences, or other identifies
    such as the use of capital letters, amount of words in your
    sentence, etc. Examples of what a Bloodhound could say to the
    Wolfpack about their code: "If I say 'Good afternoon everyone', has
    a role", "If I quote 's song lyrics, the person I checked has a
    role", "The first role that I mention in chat will be the role my
    target has", "The amount of words in my first message will
    correspond with the position of my target's role in the How2Play
    role list, counting from the top"... As you can imagine, there are
    many ways in which you can encrypt a message, whilst still adhering
    to the rules\!
