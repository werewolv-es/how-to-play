# Bloodthirster

The Bloodthirster is a powerful addition to the Wolfpack. Each night
that the Bloodthirster is alive and there are more than 4 members of the
Wolfpack alive, the Wolfpack gains an extra kill.

## Role Type

  - The Bloodthirster is seen as a member of the Wolfpack by the Seer.
  - The Bloodthirster is not seen as a user of witchcraft by the Witch
    Hunter.
  - The Bloodthirster is seen visiting by the Harlot/Stalker/Familiar
    only if they are the killing wolf.
  - The Bloodthirster is seen as a killer by the Adjudicator.

## Notes

  - Different wolves must take each of the available kills.
  - The Bloodthirster may act as a killing wolf.
  - Once the Wolfpack has fewer than 5 living wolves, the Bloodthirster
    is effectively a regular Werewolf.
