# Direwolf

The Direwolf is an imposing werewolf whose mere presence causes terror amongst those nearby. The Direwolf is able to block a player from using their ability at night. The Direwolf is also able to mislead any Seer who checks them.

## Role Type

- The Direwolf is seen as a member of the village by the Seer.
- The Direwolf is not seen as a user of witchcraft.
- The Direwolf is seen visiting by the Harlot/Stalker/Familiar.
- The Direwolf is seen as a killer by the Adjudicator.

## Tips

- For some general tips on how to play as a member of the Wolfpack, look at the corresponding section in the 'Factions' page.
- Not being detected by a Seer, the Direwolf has some more freedom in their playing style. You may become a controversial character only to have you cleared by a Seer (and thereby giving the Wolfpack a kill target).
- Some players are wary of the Direwolf, and in these situations being seen as village member alone will not guarantee your safety - especially if there are reports of Direwolf activity in the village. This is one of the reasons why some Direwolves wait until later in the game with using their ability.
- The Direwolf is effective if they can block protective and/or visit detection roles, allowing the Wolfpack to kill valuable village members unhindered and without fear of being caught.
- The Direwolf appears and acts very much like the Courtesan. It can be hard for the village to tell them apart.

## Notes

- The Direwolf does not attack their target and therefore does not trigger abilities like that of the Huntsman or Shaman.
- If there are no killing wolves left in the Wolfpack, the Direwolf will become a normal Werewolf. The Direwolf is the last to revert, the Bloodletter and Bloodhound reverting first.
- The Direwolf cannot block a Succubus, Djinn or any role with night-immunity. The Direwolf may block a Sleepwalker and Insomniac, even though these roles may not even be aware that they had a special ability at all.
- If the Direwolf is blocked by another role-blocker, they will receive the normal "You were role-blocked last night" message, but the block will have no effect.
- A Direwolf can be redirected by a Succubus.
- If the target of the Direwolf's block used their ability, then it will be as if it was not used. (This means that limited-use abilities are not depleted if they are activated but blocked and roles that normally can not target the same player twice will be able to retarget their attempted target.)

## Role Text

- The target of the Direwolf receives a message in the morning: **"You were role-blocked last night, your night action did not take place."** - even if they did not use their ability, or did not have an ability to be blocked.
