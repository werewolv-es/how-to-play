# Direwolf

The Direwolf is an imposing werewolf whose mere presence causes terror
amongst those nearby. The Direwolf is able to block a player from using
their ability at night. The Direwolf is also able to mislead any Seer
who checks them.

## Role Type

  - The Direwolf is seen as a member of the village by the Seer.
  - The Direwolf is not seen as a user of witchcraft.
  - The Direwolf is seen visiting by the Harlot/Stalker/Familiar.
  - The Direwolf is seen as a killer by the Adjudicator.

## Tips for playing Direwolf

  - For some general tips on how to play as a member of the Wolfpack,
    look at the corresponding section in the 'Factions' page.
  - Not being detected by a Seer, the Direwolf has some more freedom in
    their playing style. You may become a controversial character only
    to have you cleared by a Seer (and thereby giving the Wolfpack a
    kill target).
  - Some players are wary of the Direwolf, and in these situations being
    seen as village member alone will not guarantee your safety -
    especially if there are reports of Direwolf activity in the village.
    This is one of the reasons why some Direwolves wait until later in
    the game with using their ability.
  - The Direwolf is effective if they can block protective and/or visit
    detection roles, allowing the Wolfpack to kill valuable village
    members unhindered and without fear of being caught.
  - The Direwolf appears and acts very much like the Courtesan. It can
    be hard for the village to tell them apart.

## Notes

  - The Direwolf does not attack their target and therefore does not
    trigger abilities like that of the Huntsman or Shaman.
  - If there are no killing wolves left in the Wolfpack, the Direwolf
    will become a normal Werewolf. The Direwolf is the last to revert,
    the Bloodhound and Bloodletter reverting first.
  - The Direwolf cannot block a Succubus, Djinn or any role with
    night-immunity. The Direwolf may block a Sleepwalker and Insomniac,
    even though these roles may not even be aware that they had a
    special ability at all.
  - If the Direwolf is blocked by another role-blocker, they will
    receive the normal "You were role-blocked last night" message, but
    the block will have no effect.
  - A Direwolf can be redirected by a Succubus.
  - If the target of the Direwolf's block used their ability, then it
    will be as if it was not used. (This means that limited-use
    abilities are not depleted if they are activated but blocked and
    roles that normally can not target the same player twice will be
    able to retarget their attempted target.)

## Role Text

  - The target of the Direwolf receives a message in the morning: **"You
    were role-blocked last night, your night action did not take
    place."** - even if they did not use their ability, or did not have
    an ability to be blocked.
