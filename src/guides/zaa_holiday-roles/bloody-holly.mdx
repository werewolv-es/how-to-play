# Bloody Holly

The Bloody Holly is a neutral aligned, evil role. Each night they leave a lovely, blood-soaked wreath of holly on the door of a player of their choosing.

## Role Type

- The Bloody Holly is seen as a Malevolent Spirit by the Seer.
- The Bloody Holly is not seen as a user of witchcraft.
- The Bloody Holly is seen visiting by the Harlot/Stalker/Familiar.
- The Bloody Holly is not seen as a killer by the Adjudicator.
- The Bloody Holly is night immune - they cannot be killed at night, roleblocked, or redirected.

## Notes

- The Bloody Holly's goal is to survive to the victory of any evil faction - if they are alive when an evil faction reaches parity, the Bloody Holly wins with them.
- Each night, you may visit one target to hang a wreath on their door. This initial gift can be seen as a visit, and places a Bloody Wreath item into the player's inventory.
- Each wreath is soaked either with Werewolf, Vampiric, or Demonic blood. If a player ends the night holding any two wreaths of different blood types, the wreaths will ignite, destroying them and killing the player.
- Wreaths, once gifted, can be passed like any other item.
- The village must eliminate the Bloody Holly in order to win, even if no other evils remain.
- If a game has multiple Bloody Hollies, they do not share a night chat, but can win together so long as they survive to an evil faction gaining parity.
