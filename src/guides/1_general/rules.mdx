## Rules

In general, you can lie and say pretty much whatever you want during a game of werewolves. However, there are some ground rules:

- No personal insults, racism, sexism, homophobic remarks etc - keep it civil!
- No copy/pasting/screenshots of role information, night messages or mod messages.
- No talking about an active game anywhere outside of the game room itself.
- Do not ask for (or volunteer) information from outside the game.
- Do not reveal your real identity anywhere outside of your team's night chat.

### Problems or Issues

If something unexpected happens or you are unsure of anything, the following rules apply:

- If you suspect there is a bug in the game, contact a mod directly. If they are available and it's possible for them to help, they will.
- You are free to mention a suspected bug in game **but if you do the mod will not backfill any information for you, nor confirm or deny any bug existence whilst the game is active.** This is to avoid a bug being used to confirm a player's role.
