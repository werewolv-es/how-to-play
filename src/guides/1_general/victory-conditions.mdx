# Victory Conditions

Every faction in the game has certain victory conditions. Once the conditions are met the game will end in a victory for the corresponding faction. Most factions win by reaching parity with the Village (with some extra conditions). Parity is reached when the number of players in a certain faction is at least half of the total alive player count. A game will continue running until a faction has accomplished all their victory conditions. There is only one faction that can win per game, there are no shared victories or draws possible.

The victory conditions are checked at dawn and nightfall, after a possible lynch is executed (nightfall) or after all kills and/or revives are reported to the village (dawn). If the game ends a public message will be broadcasted, and the players will be talk to each other in the post-game lobby. The players' account names now appear next to their characters' names, and the role they had appear in the sidebar.

A faction wins right after dawn or nightfall, if all the listed conditions are met:

## The Village

Lynch all members of evil factions.

- Puppets and Zombies do not have to be killed for this condition to be met.

### Illuminati

The Illuminati win with the village assuming the following additional conditions are also met (The rest-of the village will still win if they are not met):

- Ensure that there are only 0 or 1 Masons remaining.

### Inquisition

The Inquisition win with the village assuming the following additional conditions are also met (The rest-of the village will still win if they are not met):

- Ensure that there are no Witchcraft users remaining.

## The Wolfpack and the Bloodmoon Cult

Reach parity with the Village.

Kill all Vampires, Coven members, Undead and/or _other evil creatures_: as long as any member of one of these factions is alive, the Werewolves cannot win.

- Puppets and Zombies do not count as players for this parity check.
- Cult members count towards the Wolfpack parity check.

## The Coven

Reach parity with the Village.

Kill all Vampires, Werewolves, Undead and/or _other evil creatures_: as long as any member of one of these factions is alive, the Coven cannot win.

- Puppets and Zombies do not count as players for this parity check.

## The Vampires

For every basement separately: reach parity with the Village (one basement is one Vampire (Master) and their Familiar(s)).

Vampires can win through parity even if Werewolves, Coven members and/or Undead are still present, but no _other evil creatures_ are allowed to be alive if victory is to be achieved.

- Puppets count as players for this parity check.
- If the Vampire is not alive, their Familiars count as members of the village in the parity check for other factions. Familiars alone cannot prevent another faction from winning through parity.

## The Undead

Reach parity with the Village.

Kill all Werewolves, Vampires, Coven members, and/or _other evil creatures_: as long as any member of one of these factions is alive, the Undead cannot win.

- Puppets and Zombies do not count as players for this parity check.
