# Displaced

The Displaced is a neutral role that is created by the Essence Thief stealing the player's original role.

Once a player has become displaced, they must recover their original role before the game ends in order to not lose.

## Role Type

- The Displaced is seen as a Neutral Party by the Seer.
- The Displaced is seen as a user of witchcraft.
- The Displaced is seen visiting by the Harlot/Stalker/Familiar.
- The Displaced is not seen as a killer by the Adjudicator.

## Notes

- The Displaced is only used in Speed Games.
- If the original role of the Displaced uses a one-time ability, the ability will be recharged once they steal their role back.
