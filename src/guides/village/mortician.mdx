## Mortician

The Mortician is able to discover the exact method used to kill a
player. The Mortician is also able to determine if the dead player is a
member of the Undead.

### Role Type

  - The Mortician is seen as member of the village by the Seer.
  - The Mortician is not seen as a user of witchcraft.
  - The Mortician is seen visiting by the Harlot/Stalker/Familiar.
  - The Mortician is not seen as a killer by the Adjudicator.

### Notes

  - Killed by a Wolf: "Mauled by pointy claws".
  - Killed by a Militia: "Shot to the head".
  - Killed by a Voodoo Doctor: "The brain was missing".
  - Killed by a Vampire: "Drained of blood".
  - Killed by lynching: "Hung by the Neck".
  - Killed by a Witch: "Killed by Magic".
  - Killed by a Furie: "Killed by Magic".
  - If the player died by any other means, the report will be
    "Undetermined".

### Tips for playing Mortician

  - Since the report for checking a lynched player is always the same as
    compared to night kills, you should only dig a lynched player if you
    have suspicions that they might be an Undead member or to confirm a
    swap of a previously-checked player.
