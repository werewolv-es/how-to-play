## Stalker

The Stalker can follow one player during the night. In the morning, the
Stalker will get a report telling them who their target visited last
night.

### Role Type

  - The Stalker is seen as member of the village by the Seer.
  - The Stalker is not seen as a user of witchcraft.
  - The Stalker is seen visiting by the Harlot/Familiar/another Stalker.
  - The Stalker is not seen as a killer by the Adjudicator.

### Notes

  - The Stalker is free to choose the same target multiple nights in a
    row.
  - The Vampire's Familiar has a nightly ability identical to the
    Stalker. These roles also receive the same morning report.
  - The Stalker cannot observe some (parts of) abilities that are used
    on (living) players. These are the Djinn-swap and the target to
    which a Succubus redirects another player. So if a Djinn is stalked
    no visit is reported, and if a Succubus is stalked, the Succubus is
    only seen visiting the person they're redirecting, not the person
    they're redirecting to.
  - Roles that "visit themselves" are not seen by the Stalker. These
    include: the Messiah, the Tarot Reader, and the Shapeshifter. The
    Protector and Shaman can visit themselves if they use their
    defensive ability on themselves. It is also possible for a Succubus
    to redirect someone to themselves, making them appear self-visiting.
  - If the Stalker targets the 'killing wolf' they will get a report
    their target visited the person who died in the night. All other
    Wolfpack members are not necessarily seen visiting this target (it
    is still possible for Wolfpack members to be seen visiting the
    same/another player because of abilities they have used). For an
    explanation of how the Wolfpack's kill system works, see the
    corresponding section in the Factions page.

### Tips for playing Stalker

  - As a Stalker, you can see players visiting other players. This tells
    you that they have a certain role, although you cannot be sure which
    role they have. So your information is usually only a starting point
    for further investigation.
  - Once you've shared your report(s), the people that you've stalked
    can now explain why they were seen visiting. In addition, players
    can compare your information with their own - they might be able to
    tie the visit to other events in the game and so create a better
    image of other players' identities.
  - You have to consider whether/when it is wise to share your
    information, and how much of your information you want to share.
    Sometimes, it may be better to only share only a portion of your
    information, and not all of it, at once. Your information may expose
    important village members to the evil faction(s). On the other hand,
    you may force your enemies to account for their visit(s), meaning
    they have to come up with some story that can be verified by the
    village.
  - If you see that someone has visited a player who died the same
    night, you cannot be sure that this person actually killed the
    deceased player. But it is still likely, and usually this is a good
    moment for you to speak up\!
