## Agitator

The Agitator is a village-aligned role. Once per game at night they can
whip the village into a frenzy and force the village to make 2 lynches
the following day.

### Role Type

  - The Agitator is seen as member of the village by the Seer.
  - The Agitator is not seen as a user of witchcraft.
  - The Agitator visits themselves to activate their ability.
  - The Agitator is not seen as a killer by the Adjudicator.

### Notes

  - The whole village will get a message on the morning after the
    Agitator has used their ability to let them know there will be 2
    forced lynches.
  - Once the Agitator ability has been activated, there will be 2
    lynches on that day. This cannot be avoided.
  - If there is a tied or balanced number of votes on the highest vote
    stacks then a random member of that stack will be lynched.
  - If no players are voted for, 2 players from the whole village will
    be randomly lynched.
  - Puppets, Zombies and Silenced players behave as normal and their
    vote doesn't count. This can influence the stacks at the end of the
    day.
  - Shrouded players count as having 0 votes.
  - Multiple Agitators do not stack. If more than 1 uses their ability
    on the same night, there will still only be 2 lynches the following
    day.

### Tips for playing Agitator

  - If the village suspects multiple players during a given day, the
    Agitator can use their ability to help the village lynch 2 of them
    the following day.
  - The Agitator ability is strong later in the game when there is more
    intel. You might want to avoid using it until there are multiple
    clear lynch targets.
