# Novice Tarot Reader

The Novice Tarot Reader is a member of the Village. They are able to select two players at night to draw cards from. Five cards will be drawn, two of which correspond to each player chosen. A random card will be drawn that corresponds to a random player. The order of the cards drawn are randomized.

Each card reflects one of three facets - alignment, killing ability, and witchcraft status. There are some cards that can be interpreted in two ways, for example, Magician meaning both a witchcraft user and a Coven member.

Novice Tarot Reader Keys:

> ALIGNMENT:
> Innocence (Villager) | Hound (Wolf) | Magician (Coven) | Puppet (Wood) | Neutral (Balanced Scales) | Undead (Death) | Damned (Chains) | Zombie (Brains) | Demon (Brimstone) | Undefined (Shadow)
> 
> KILLING ABILITY:
> Killer (Death) | Non-Killer (Dove)
> 
> WITCHCRAFT ABILITY:
> Witchcraft (Magician) | NonWitchcraft (Labourer)

## Role Type

- The Novice Tarot Reader is seen as member of the village by the Seer.
- The Novice Tarot Reader is seen as a user of witchcraft.
- The Novice Tarot Reader is seen visiting by the Harlot/Stalker/Familiar.
- The Novice Tarot Reader is not seen as a killer by the Adjudicator.

## Notes

- Items are factored into the card readings. For example, a Milita (who does not use witchcraft) that is holding a Rune (causing witchcraft status to other witchcraft-detecting roles), may cause a Magician card to be drawn. Similarly, a Seer with a crossbow may cause a Death card to appear.

## Tips

- People may be distrusting of a Novice Tarot Reader, as the card reads can be intentionally made vague to force opponents to claim a role that is difficult to get the village to believe without evidence.
