    Illuminati members.

    not who was actually visited.

## Tips for playing Illuminati Lookout

  - The Illuminati Lookout is very useful to the Illuminati for helping
    find people to recruit. (village intel roles who visit the
    Illuminati without killing are usually good recruitment targets).
  - The Illuminati Lookout is also useful at finding evil non-killing
    roles such as Djinns, Succubi or Direwolves who may cause trouble
    for Illuminati intel roles.
  - It can be useful to have code words to let you tell your team
    members who visited at night without exposing yourself to the rest
    of the village.
  - Every lethal visitor to the Illuminati does not necessarily HAVE to
    be evil. You might be under attack by the Masons\!
