# Messiah

The Messiah is a village-aligned role that, once per game, can sacrifice their own life during the night. On the dawn of the third day of their death, they will be revived.

## Role Type

- The Messiah is seen as member of the village by the Seer.
- The Messiah is not seen as a user of witchcraft.
- The Messiah visits themselves to activate their ability.
- The Messiah is not seen as a killer by the Adjudicator.

## Notes

- The Messiah is (only) seen visiting themselves on the night of their sacrifice.
- If the Messiah is killed (during the night), their ability does not trigger automatically. If the Messiah uses their ability on the night that another player tries to kill them as well, the Messiah's ability does trigger.
- The Succubus cannot redirect a Messiah in order to prevent them from using their ability (successfully).
- The Messiah can be resurrected by a Reviver or Witch before they would naturally return.

## Tips

- Your ability allows you to go to the Graveyard and talk to the people there, in order to gain information. The village will be able to use this information upon your return.
- You have to choose the right moment for using your ability. A sacrifice too soon will limit the amount of information you can gather from the dead. But a sacrifice near the end of the game may cause the evil factions to win due to parity with the village, since you do not count towards the number of villagers left whilst you are dead. If you wait longer with using your ability you also increase the risk you are killed beforehand.
- Remember that the dead may lie to try and influence the village, so don't take anyone's word for truth - not even in the Graveyard. Whether the dead can be trusted also depends on which factions are in play. In a game where it's only the Wolfpack versus the village, anyone that is killed at night should be trustworthy. But in a game with Coven members, for example, you cannot even automatically trust people that are killed at night!
- Some Messiahs hint their role the night before they use their ability - by that time it will be too late for evil factions to stop them, and now the village knows that a Messiah is among them! The upside to doing this is that the village has an explanation for you being killed at night, the downside to doing this is that evil factions can take your return into consideration when making plans (for example, Shapeshifters would not use their ability until the day of your return).
