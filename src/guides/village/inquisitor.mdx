# Inquisitor

The Inquisitor is a member of the Village and the Inquisition who is able to check a player once per night to see if they require the cleansing fire of the Inquisition.

## Role Type

- The Inquisitor is seen as member of the village by the Seer.
- The Inquisitor is not seen as a user of witchcraft.
- The Inquisitor is seen visiting by the Harlot/Stalker/Familiar.
- The Inquisitor is not seen as a killer by the Adjudicator.

## Notes

- At night you can find if a player is a user of Witchcraft.

## Tips

- The Inquisitor can help the Inquisition Leader find suitable recruits by looking for non-recruitable players.
- Purifiers and WitchHunters make excellent recruits and will be shown as "a Fanatic" from the check. As a member of the Inquisition, you will want to recruit this player if possible to incentivise them to help your goal of eradicating Witchcraft.

## Role Text

- If you find a Witchcraft user, you will get a message "**_Player_ is a Heretic. They should burn**"
- If you find a non-Witchcraft user, you will get a message "**_Player_ is Faithful. They can be spared the righteous flame**"
- If you find a Purifier or Witch Hunter, you will get a message "**_Player_ is a Fanatic. They would make an excellent recruit for the Inquisition**"
