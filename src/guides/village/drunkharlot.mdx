## Drunk Harlot

The Drunk Harlot works like a normal Harlot, however, they have a chance to have one too many drinks, forgetting what they saw the previous night.

Whether the Drunk Harlot forgets their target's visitors or not depends on drawing a drunk/sober result from a randomised bag. The bag contains two drunk results and three sober results. Once a result is drawn, it not replaced. Meaning that if you are drunk on the first two nights, you are guaranteed to get a successful check on the third. The bag is reshuffled when there is only one item remaining in it, so an order such as:

> DRUNK, DRUNK, SOBER, SOBER, DRUNK

is an entirely possible sequence of results.
