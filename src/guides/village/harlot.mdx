# Harlot

The Harlot is a powerful village-aligned role. Each night, they can
observe a single living player and see who visit that player that night.
In the morning, the Harlot will receive a report on the visiting
players.

## Role Type

  - The Harlot is seen as member of the village by the Seer.
  - The Harlot is not seen as a user of witchcraft.
  - The Harlot is seen visiting by the Stalker/Familiar/another Harlot.
  - The Harlot is not seen as a killer by the Adjudicator.

## Notes

  - The Harlot cannot visit the last player that they successfully
    visited.
  - The Harlot cannot observe some (parts of) abilities that are used on
    (living) players. These are the Djinn-swap and the target to which a
    Succubus redirects another player.
  - If the Harlot observes the person that is being killed by the
    Wolfpack that night, the Harlot will only see one killing wolf as
    visitor (along with any other people that are visiting the target).
    For an explanation of how the Wolfpack's kill system works, see the
    corresponding section in the Factions page.
  - There are some roles that visibly self-visit when using their
    ability. These are: the Messiah, the Tarot Reader, and the
    Shapeshifter. The Protector and Shaman can visit themselves if they
    use their defensive ability on themselves. It is also possible for a
    Succubus to redirect someone to themselves, making them appear
    self-visiting.

## Tips for playing Harlot

  - When using your ability at night, you can either try to confirm
    village-aligned visitors or catch an evil (killing) role. This means
    that you can choose somebody who is suspicious/needs confirmation,
    and may be visited by other village intel roles, or somebody who
    appears to be important for the village and will likely have
    protective roles and/or evil killing roles visiting them.
  - You have to consider when it is wise to claim your role and speak
    up. You will have to weigh the risk you take by exposing yourself
    against the value of the information you can share. You will also
    have to consider which information you share: if you announce whom
    you have seen visiting which players, you may force these visiting
    players to claim a role, creating clarity for the village. The
    downside is that you may thereby expose village roles.
  - The Harlot combines very effectively with a protective role. The
    protective role can keep the Harlot safe, while the Harlot watches
    the protective role - no killer would dare to attack the protective
    role, because they would surely be caught by you\! The village
    regularly uses this principle even if they cannot guarantee
    everyone's safety: a Protector/Huntsman, a Harlot, and a Seer may
    work together this way. The protective role and the Harlot
    guard/watch one of both others, and keeping all three safe. Even if
    no one out of the three is guaranteed safe in this setup, most
    Werewolves/Vampires would not dare to take the risk to attack one of
    the three\!
  - As seen from the previous example, the Harlot's ability can be used
    just like the Protector's/Huntsman's: it can guarantee the safety of
    an important village member. This is why, sometimes, you may want to
    withhold information about who you watched at night, since the evil
    factions will then know this person cannot be watched by you the
    next night. If you wish to take a risk, you may even watch another
    person than the person you were intended/declared to watch, so that
    the next night - when the evil factions think they're safe - you can
    catch them red-handed\!
