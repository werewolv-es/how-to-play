# Courtesan

The Courtesan is a member of the Village. Each night they may visit a
single living player and block them from using their ability at night.
In the morning the target recieves a message indicating they have been
blocked.

## Role Type

  - The Courtesan is seen as member of the village by the Seer.
  - The Courtesan is not seen as a user of witchcraft.
  - The Courtesan is seen visiting by the Harlot/Stalker/Familiar.
  - The Courtesan is not seen as a killer by the Adjudicator.

## Notes on the Courtesan

  - The Courtesan cannot block a Succubus, Djinn, or any role with
    night-immunity. They may block a Sleepwalker and Insomniac, even
    though these roles may not even be aware that they had a special
    ability at all.
  - If the Courtesan is blocked by another role-blocker, they will
    receive the normal "You were role-blocked last night" message, but
    the block will have no effect.
  - The Courtesan can be redirected by a Succubus.
  - If the target of the Courtesan's block used their ability, then it
    will be as if it was not used. (This means that limited-use
    abilities are not depleted if they are activated but blocked and
    roles that normally can not target the same player twice will be
    able to retarget their attempted target.)

## Tips for playing Courtesan

  - The Courtesan appears and acts very much like the Direwolf. It can
    be hard for the village to tell them apart.
  - Choose your targets carefully - you don't want to accidentally block
    a village role.

## Role Text

  - The target of the Courtesan receives a message in the morning:
    **"You were role-blocked last night, your night action did not take
    place."** - even if they did not use their ability, or did not have
    an ability to be blocked.
