## Drunk Seer

The Drunk Seer works like a normal
Seer, however, they have a
chance to have one too many drinks, forgetting what they saw the
previous night.

Whether the Drunk Seer forgets their check or not depends on drawing a
drunk/sober result from a randomised bag. The bag contains two drunk
results and three sober results. Once a result is drawn, it not
replaced. Meaning that if you are drunk on the first two nights, you are
guaranteed to get a successful check on the third. The bag is reshuffled
when there is only one item remaining in it - so

    DRUNK, DRUNK, SOBER, SOBER, DRUNK

is an entirely possible sequence of results.
