# Gravedigger

The Gravedigger is able to discover the exact role of a dead player at
night.

## Role Type

  - The Gravedigger is seen as member of the village by the Seer.
  - The Gravedigger is not seen as a user of witchcraft.
  - The Gravedigger is seen visiting by the Harlot/Stalker/Familiar.
  - The Gravedigger is not seen as a killer by the Adjudicator.

## Notes

  - If the Gravedigger checks the corpse of a Shapeshifter who
    successfully shifted away, their report will come up as
    "Undetermined".
  - If, after a successful shift, the Shapeshifter dies and is checked,
    their report will come up as "Werewolf".

## Tips for playing Gravedigger

  - If somebody claims to have incriminating evidence on somebody and
    wants that person lynched, a Gravedigger's information may at least
    verify whether the evidence was real or fake.
  - Your information can help to guide a Reviver to pick the right
    target. This is why you should speak up when you find an important
    role in the Graveyard. On the other hand, you may want to keep some
    information hidden about the Graveyard. For example, revealing that
    some/all protective roles are in the Graveyard may do more harm than
    good to the village, because now the evil factions know this as
    well.
  - If you find an uncommon role (village or evil) in the Graveyard, it
    may be wise to speak up - it may be very important information for
    the village to understand more about the setup of the game. For
    example: games including a Witch Hunter will have a
    greater-than-average chance to include Shapeshifters and/or Coven
    members.
  - Getting an "Undetermined" report, i.e. finding a Shapeshifter who
    shifted away, is something you should definitely share with the
    village - your report indicates that an important/trusted village
    member may have been shifted into, and sharing this information may
    turn the whole game around\!
  - There is one exception to the Gravedigger's ability to discover the
    exact role of a dead character: the Familiar. The Gravedigger cannot
    discover the role type of the Familiar
    (Stalker/Gravedigger/Militia).
