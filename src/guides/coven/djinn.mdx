# Djinn

The Djinn is a member of the Coven who can manipulate the appearance of others: they are able to swap the identities of two players each night.

Only the identities of the players are swapped, the players retain their role and affiliation.

## Role Type

- The Djinn is seen as a member of the Coven by the Seer.
- The Djinn is seen as a user of witchcraft by the Witch Hunter.
- The Djinn is not seen visiting by the Harlot/Stalker/Familiar.
- The Djinn is not seen as a killer by the Adjudicator.

## Notes

- Djinn-swaps happen at the very end of the morning, so any intel roles (Gravedigger, Harlot, Familiar, ...) will get a report on the original player, not the swapped one (see 'Order of night actions' in the Basics section).
- Djinn-swaps happening last also means that you cannot prevent somebody from dying by swapping them at night - if they are targeted the same night as they are swapped, they will die. The village will get a notification that someone else died, though (whoever you swapped them with).
- The Djinn's targets must both be alive, or both be dead. The Djinn cannot swap a living player and a dead player. It can still happen that one of both living targets dies that night, of course.

## Tips

- For some general tips on how to play as a member of the Coven, look at the corresponding section in the 'Factions' page.
- Any Coven team with a Djinn should be conscious of how they type from the start of the game. The Djinn allows one player to be another, but this is only effective if the village does not suspect a Djinn-swap has taken place. The village will check for likeness in typing styles between players, and also look at things like activity times and voting patterns. If somebody is Djinn-swapped and does not want the village to notice this, they should try to resemble the other person as much as possible. Some Coven members, in a game with a Djinn, choose to type differently than their usual style before they are swapped, so their typing styles will match less.
- If a fellow Coven member is in danger of getting lynched, you can swap them with a Puppet (see Puppetmaster). It is important that the village does not suspect that the Djinn-swap has taken place!
- Swapping dead players will make it much harder for the village to revive the right players - perhaps you can even get a fellow Coven member back from the Graveyard!
- Combined with a killing potion used by the Witch, the Djinn's power can shift a member of the Coven into a cleared role with no other witnesses to contest. This combination of actions resembles the Wolfpack's Shapeshifter.
- Not using your ability from the start may be helpful (except perhaps on dead players), because Djinn-swaps immediately alerts the village to the presence of Coven. If the village does not anticipate a Djinn in the village, they can become much more effective.
- You can also turn things around: do not use your ability, but still claim that a Djinn-swap has occurred!
