# Furie

The Furie is a member of the Coven who blends offense and defense. Their night ability is based on whether or not the village lynches that day.

If the village has lynched a player during the day, the Furie's visit that night will _protect_.

If the village did not lynch a player during the day, the Furie's visit that night will _kill_.

## Role Type

- The Furie is seen as a member of the Coven by the Seer.
- The Furie is seen as a user of witchcraft.
- The Furie is seen visiting by the Harlot/Stalker/Familiar.
- The Furie is seen as a killer by the Adjudicator.

## Notes

- The Furie does not receive a power on night 1.
- The Furie cannot visit themselves.
- The protection ability is the same as the village Protector (see Protector page for interactions with other roles).
- The kill ability is the same as a regular Werewolf (see Werewolf page for interactions with other roles).
- The protect ability **can** be used on the same target two nights in a row.
- The kill ability can be blocked by a Protector, Shaman or Huntsman (the last of which will kill you).

## Tips

- Consider claiming the role of Protector, Witch Hunter or Militia - after all you have some of those abilities (sometimes).
- Kill your enemies, protect your friends, or protect your enemies to avoid suspicion.
- You are at the mercy of whether or not a lynch happens, so try to guide the village towards the outcome you need to get the power you want that night.
- Combine with Harpy for interesting results.

## Role Text

One of two messages appears at night time to indicate which ability is active:

- **"You are pleased by the lynch. Tonight you will protect the player you choose to visit."** appears if protect is active.
- **"The lack of death angers you. Tonight you will kill the player you choose to visit."** appears if kill is active.
