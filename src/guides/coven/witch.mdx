# Witch

The Witch is a member of the Coven who possesses two potions: one can
kill, the other can revive a dead player. Both potions can only be used
once.

## Role Type

  - The Witch is seen as a member of the Coven by the Seer.
  - The Witch is seen as a user of witchcraft.
  - The Witch is seen visiting by the Harlot/Stalker/Familiar.
  - The Witch is seen as a killer by the Adjudicator.

## Notes

  - Both the Witch's potions are seen as visit. Since the Witch can use
    both potions the same night, it is possible that she is seen
    visiting two players.
  - When a player is revived by the Witch, the village receives the same
    message as they would if a Reviver used their power.
  - The Witch's kill potion ignores a Protector, Shaman, and/or Huntsman
    guarding the target.
  - A role with night-immunity cannot be killed by the Witch's potion.

## Tips for playing Witch

  - For some general tips on how to play as a member of the Coven, look
    at the corresponding section in the 'Factions' page.
  - A Witch has the combined abilities of a Reviver and a Militia - she
    can prove herself as either of these roles. Note: a Reviver is seen
    visiting when they revive, a Witch is not - this detail may cost
    you\!
  - It is often helpful to save the kill potion - if circumstances
    permit it - to a later stage in the game, when you have more
    knowledge about the game; unless you can expect that you will not
    survive for long.
  - If you revive a fellow Coven member at the right time, they may
    pretend to be a Messiah returning from the game. Note: because this
    has been done by Coven teams on several occasions, the alleged
    Messiah may be treated with suspicion when returning to the village.
    A Djinn may help here by changing your deceased teammate into a
    character who is most believable as Messiah.
