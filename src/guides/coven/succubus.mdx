# Succubus

The Succubus is a member of the Coven who can redirect the abilities of
other players at night.

## Role Type

  - The Succubus is seen as a member of the Coven by the Seer.
  - The Succubus is seen as a user of witchcraft.
  - The Succubus is seen visiting by the Harlot/Stalker/Familiar (see
    Notes).
  - The Succubus is not seen as a killer by the Adjudicator.

## Notes

  - For Stalker, Familiar, and Harlot checks, the Succubus is considered
    to only have visited the controlled player, not their target.
  - The Omegawolf, Vampire, and Vampire Master are immune to the
    Succubus
  - The Succubus can redirect Wolfpack members to kill each other.
  - The Succubus can redirect the Protector and Huntsman to protect the
    same player twice in a row.
  - If a Protector or Huntsman is manipulated, they will be unable to
    guard that target again the following night (although the Succubus
    could force them to).
  - The Succubus can manipulate players into targeting either living or
    dead players. The Gravedigger cannot learn the role of a living
    player, but the Seer can learn the alignment of a dead player.
  - The manipulated player is not notified that they have been
    controlled, but intel reports will usually contain the target's name
    in them, so players should study their reports carefully and check
    them for redirects.
  - If the Succubus tries to redirect the killing wolf, while the
    killing wolf is being lured by the Shaman's totem, the Shaman's
    ability dominates.

## Tips for playing Succubus

  - For some general tips on how to play as a member of the Coven, look
    at the corresponding section in the 'Factions' page.
  - You can steer village intel roles away from the Coven and towards
    the Wolfpack, or also away from them, depending on what is
    convenient for your team.
  - If you have redirected someone and their new target dies, you may
    have found a killing wolf. You could use this to your advantage and
    control who the Wolfpack kills, as long as they don't choose a new
    killing wolf.
  - It is sometimes helpful for a Succubus to not use their ability
    until later in the game, so that the village does not anticipate a
    redirect - the Succubus can then strike at a crucial moment\!
