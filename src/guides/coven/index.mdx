## The Coven

The Coven is a third party who specialises in creating chaos and
confusion amongst the village members. They have limited kill power and
rely on manipulation to win the game. Games that include the Coven
usually have a Wolfpack and/or a Vampire present as well, in order to
have a consistent source of kills during the night.

For the Coven to win, they need to eliminate all members of other evil
factions, and their numbers should equal those of the remaining village
members.

  - The Seer's check will reveal a member of the Coven
  - The Gravedigger's check will reveal the full role of a Coven member
    (as normal)
  - The Bloodhound's check will reveal the full role of a Coven member
    (as normal)
  - Coven members can be killed at night

### Tips for playing as Coven

  - The Coven needs another evil faction, with killing power, to be
    present in the game. This is a Wolfpack and/or a Vampire. The Coven
    should focus on finding out who the other evil faction members are,
    and allow them to live just long enough so that they can kill plenty
    of village members. Then, once the village's numbers have dwindled
    enough, the Coven should get rid of the Wolfpack/Vampire. For the
    Coven to succeed, they should have a more trusted position in the
    village during the stage that they are getting rid of the
    Wolfpack/Vampire (in order to convince the village to steer the
    lynch votes in the right direction), but should not be
    exposed/attacked during the earlier stages of the game.
  - The Coven and the Wolfpack/Vampire have a common enemy: the village.
    This shared interest is something that may steer them in working
    together, for a limited amount of time. Evils from different
    factions may help each other out by 'confirming' each other with
    their alleged roles. It is also the common interest of the evil
    factions to tell a lie about certain events that have taken place,
    as it may discredit actual village members and/or create space for
    the evil factions to operate freely. This also means that, if you
    see a non-Coven member assisting you in the creation of some lie,
    you have a strong indication that they are not a village member.
    Note that they may now have the same information about you\!
  - The Coven's main power is to create ambiguity in as many aspects of
    the game as possible; about the identities of players, about how
    certain events such as deaths and revives can be explained, etc. The
    Coven can thrive better if the village has no basis of certain
    knowledge to operate on.
  - Members of the Coven should usually be aware of their typing style
    and activity pattern, at least as long there is a Djinn in the game.
    You could be swapped with another player, or with a Puppet, and to
    conceal this Djinn-swap you should be able to copy the other's
    typing style and activity pattern as well as possible.
  - The Coven has limited protection against a Wolfpack and/or a
    Vampire. This is why they shouldn't attract too much attention from
    these factions, especially at the start of the game. Ideally, the
    village and the evil killing factions are concerned with fighting
    each other, allowing the Coven to survive. Their vulnerability the
    Coven should take into account when making role claims. For example:
    claiming an important role that a Wolfpack wants dead, especially
    early in the game, is risky - you may be inspected/attacked from all
    sides.
