# Items in werewolv.es

Items were an unannounced, surprise feature in ext-300. They have appeared in games since, but are not always included in a setup.

Items are either persistent or consumable. Consumable items disappear from the game once they have been used.

Items are either active or passive. Active items must be initiated by the Player that has control of them for them to work.

Passive and Consumable items such as Steel Armour or a Wolf Pelt will offer automatic protection from a single attack, but will be consumed and lost once an attack is blocked.

Items may be stolen by roles such as a thief, stolen by killing a player or stolen by using a Potion of Acquiescence.

Items may also be passed to a player during the night.

Items which have an active ability cannot be passed and used on the same night.

Items such as the potions and other targeted items count as visits and can be seen by other roles.

More information regarding specific items will be added to the guide in good time. If you have any other questions about them, ask on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/xFHCsJ6) or on [Arqade](https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/werewolv.es).
