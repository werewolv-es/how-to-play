<h2>Vampire (Master)</h2>

<p>The structure of this role description page is slightly different from others because it describes two roles: the Vampire and the Vampire Master. 
    The roles have many similarities, both functionally and thematically, and their names look alike. For convenience, we shall refer to 'the Vampire(s)' whenever we describe characteristics both roles share, or when it is clear from the context which of both roles is described.
    Whenever there's a difference between the roles, we shall address them as 'the (original) Vampire' and 'the Vampire Master', to emphasize their difference (the term 'original Vampire' is derived from the fact that this role was introduced into the game long before the Vampire Master was).</p>
    
<p> The Vampire is a neutral killing role, whose aim is to kill all other factions in the game. If there is a Vampire in the game, the other factions' win conditions change to include the death of the Vampire. Vampires also have the ability to recruit a Familiar, a player that becomes their ally and greatly increases the Vampire's survivability (see the 'Familiar' page for a description of this role).
    The characteristics of these Familiars and how many can be recruited in a game is different for the original Vampire and the Vampire Master.</p>

<p>There can be multiple Vampires in one game, but they always form separate factions: Vampires must fight against each other in order to win the game!</p>

<h3>Role Type</h3>
<ul>
     <li>The Seer identifies the Vampires as "Vampire" and "Vampire Master", accordingly.</li>
     <li>The Vampires are not seen as a users of witchcraft by the Witch Hunter.</li>
     <li>The Vampires are seen visiting by the Harlot, Stalker, and the Familiar (Stalker).</li>
 </ul>
 
<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The Vampire cannot be killed by any nightly killing ability (by Wolfpack, Coven, and/or Village).</li>
    <li>The Vampire cannot be roleblocked by the Direwolf, purged by the Alchemist, nor redirected by the Succubus.</li>
    <li>If the Vampire's target is guarded by the Huntsman, their attack has no effect (no one dies).</li>
    <li>The Protector works as normal against a Vampire. The target is still protected even if the Werewolves AND the Vampire attack the protected target.</li>
    <li>In the event of only a Vampire and a Werewolf being left alive, the Vampire automatically wins.</li>
    <li>The night the Vampire recruits a Familiar, the Familiar cannot be killed by any ability.</li>
    <li><br /></li>
    <li>The original Vampire can recruit a single Familiar once per game, of type Stalker.</li>
    <li>The Vampire Master can recruit up to three Familiars per game. They can be of type Stalker, Gravedigger, and/or Militia. Every Familiar becomes one of these three roles randomly, and multiple Familiars can be of the same type.</li>
    <li>If the original Vampire dies and their Familiar is alive, a random player among the living is marked (visible to the Familiar). If the marked player dies, the Vampire is reborn into the Familiar's body. The players are swapped along with their roles, the transition occurring unseen by the village.</li>
    <li>If the Vampire Master dies they do not go the Graveyard, provided there is at least one Familiar alive. The Vampire Master immediately transitions into the body of the first-recruited Familiar that is still alive. The Vampire Master can only be killed through a lynch, and so the transition occurs at nightfall. The Vampire Master is able to use their ability the same night.</li>
/ul>

<h3>Tips for playing the original Vampire</h3>

<ul>
    <li>You should not wait too long with recruiting your Familiar. As long as you are still on your own, it only takes one village intel check on you to put you out of the game. Most players recruit the second night, or at least by the third night.</li> 
    <li>The Vampire uses the first days to assess which other players are active, have certain roles, are strategic players, etc. The Vampire uses this information to make the best possible recruit.</li>
    <li>In a game that includes a Vampire, there is often another evil faction present. These factions may have a certain interest in you surviving for some time, or not. Either way, they want you dead in the end, and you need to make sure that they cannot do so. For example: in a game that includes the Coven and a Vampire, the Coven wants the Vampire to survive at first, because they need the killing power. Once the village's numbers have dwindled enough, the Coven will want to kill the Vampire. It is your job to kill enough Coven members and/or gain a better standing in the village than them so that they cannot expose you later in the game.</li>
    <li>If you are reborn into your Familiar, you have to take care that people do not notice the change of player. This means that you have to be conscious of your typing style from the start of the game, and maybe change things so that your typing style matches that of the Familiar. Other things that people notice are activity times and voting patterns. If you come back from the Graveyard, try to resemble the person you are reborn into as much as possible.</li>
    <li>Consider whether it is smart to start killing at night as soon as you are reborn into your Familiar. It may be the case that the previous nights have passed without a kill, if there was no nightly killing power without you. If you start killing as soon as you are back from the Graveyard, the village may conclude that the last lynch/death was the Familiar's target. If your Familiar was involved in getting this person killed, the village may conclude from this who the Familiar was, and thus that you are the Vampire.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tips for playing the Vampire Master</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The Vampire Master is vulnerable at any moment they do not have one living Familiar. Therefore, make sure to (almost) always have at least one Familiar alive (recruiting on the first night is therefore often a good option). Even if both you and your Familiar are exposed, you cannot both be killed before you have another opportunity to recruit another Familiar (if you haven't recruited three Familiars yet).</li>
    <li>Recruiting multiple Familiars will help you create a loyal group within the village, who might be trusted by others because of their previous actions and confirmed role abilities. Familiars may be vulnerable to other killing roles, especially those of opposing evil factions. You must assess which other evil factions there are (if any), in deciding whom and when to recruit.</li> 
    <li>Based on the consideration described in the previous point you can go for creating a team of Familiars early to create a foothold in the village and be able to steer discussions and lynches, or for recruiting only one Familiar at a time and thus adopting a more elusive playstyle, keeping yourself under the radar. Of course, there are intermediate strategies, and you can always adjust your play style during the game (although you can never undo recruits, obviously).</li>
</ul>
