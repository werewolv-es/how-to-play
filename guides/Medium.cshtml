<h2>Medium</h2>

<p>The Medium is a member of the Undead. They have the ability to see Graveyard chat at all times.</p>

<h3>Notes on the Medium</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The Medium can hear everything that is said in the Graveyard at all times.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tips for playing Medium</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Like all members of the Undead, the Medium is still able to hear their faction night chat whilst in the Graveyard. If there is a Medium alive this can allow passing of information to/from the dead.</li>
    <li>Don't believe everything read from the Graveyard, people lie and will try to feed false information if they believe there is a Medium listening</li>
    <li>The rest of the undead team can't see what is being said, so it is up to the Medium to filter any important information from the Graveyard</li>
    <li>The Medium can be party to a lot of otherwise-unknown information from the Dead that can help with fake role claims or to see otherwise-hidden graveyard swaps by the Djinn</li>
    <li>The Medium can also help pre-warn their team of any negative information that may be coming up from the Graveyard from a Messiah or Revived player.</li>
    <li>If there is a Ghoul alive, the Medium can help pick players to consume based on information from the Graveyard chat.</li>
</ul>
