# Santa Claws

Santa Claws is a Werewolf-aligned role. They are not part of the Werewolf night chat, but may assist them by distributing the items they magically create.

## Role Type

- Santa Claws is seen as a member of the Wolfpack by the Seer.
- Santa Claws is not seen as a user of witchcraft.
- Santa Claws is seen visiting by the Harlot/Stalker/Familiar.
- Santa Claws is seen as a killer by the Adjudicator.
- Santa Claws is night immune - they cannot be killed at night, roleblocked, or redirected.

## Notes

- Santa Claws is aligned to the werewolves, but is not part of their night chat. Neither the werewolves nor Santa Claws knows who the other is.
- Each night, Santa Claws will randomly create either a "nice" present or a "naughty" present. They may choose a player to receive this present via their night action, placing it in their inventory.
- "Nice" presents are beneficial to the player who receives them (e.g. Crossbow, Steel Armour, elective active items).
- "Naughty" presents are disruptive to the player who receives them (e.g. Abysmal Armour, Altruistic Trinket, Disruption Orb).
- If all of the werewolves die, Santa Claws will become an Omegawolf.
