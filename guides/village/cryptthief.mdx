# Crypt Thief

The Crypt Thief is a villager that has the ability to retrieve items in the Graveyard. At night, the Thief can choose to visit a dead player and steal all of their items.

## Role Type

- The Crypt Thief is seen as member of the village by the Seer.
- The Crypt Thief is not seen as a user of witchcraft.
- The Crypt Thief is seen visiting by the Harlot/Stalker/Familiar.
- The Crypt Thief is not seen as a killer by the Adjudicator.

## Notes

This role is effectively a copy of the Thief but it targets the dead instead of the living. When it was introduced in ext-300, it was the only role that could retrieve items lost in the Graveyard.
The Ghoul has since been updated to also have an ability to scavenge items from the dead. Like its counterpart that targets the living, if multiple Crypt Thieves (or Ghouls) attempt to visit 
the same target, all of the theft attempts will bounce and the items will remain on the target.
