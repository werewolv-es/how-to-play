# Bloodmoon Cult

The Bloodmoon Cult are a group of villagers who are have become disillusioned with the village and wish to see the Wolfpack destroy the village.

During the course of the game, the Bloodmoon Cult are aiming to identify the Wolfpack and assist them in killing and lynching the rest of the village.

The Bloodmoon Cult count towards the village for the sake of parity checks against other factions, but win when the Wolfpack wins. This means that if there are more Cult members alive than Wolfpack then someone will have to be sacrificed for the greater good to allow the Wolfpack to gain parity.
