# The Wolfpack

The Wolfpack is the standard enemy of the village. This is a group of Werewolves, a secret society within the village. During the day they appear to be village members, but at night their true identity is revealed - the Wolfpack will hunt and kill village members, and also use other abilities to harm the village and to further their own agenda. The Werewolves win if during the day no other evil faction members are alive and there are as many Wolfpack members left as there are village members.

All living Wolfpack members have the ability to talk with each other in secret during the night. This is the moment when the Werewolves together decide how to use their abilities and who they should kill. There is a basic distinction between two sorts of Wolfpack members: those that have the ability to kill, and those that have other abilities. All wolves that have the ability to kill can vote for another player, similarly to how lynch votes work during the day. If one player has a majority of kill votes, one of the Werewolves that has voted for this player will become the 'killing wolf'. The killing wolf is selected at random from this group of Werewolves. The killing wolf (alone) ventures out that night to kill the target - only this Werewolf will be seen visiting the target. If there are two or more players that have the most votes by killing Wolfpack members, and thus the votes are tied, one of these players is selected at random as the Wolfpack's victim for the night. A killing wolf is randomly selected from the Werewolves who have voted for this target.

In addition to Werewolves that can kill at night, the Wolfpack has other roles at their disposal. Players with these roles are free to use their abilities in a way that benefits the Wolfpack the most. These Werewolves are not a part of the kill-voting system. Note that if, at any given night, there are no longer any Werewolves with the ability to kill, one of the non-killing Wolfpack members becomes a regular Werewolf, with the ability to kill.

## Tips

- In order to control exactly who is killed and who runs the risk of being seen visited, the Wolfpack often elects a single member of their pack to make the kill for that night. They are the only one to vote for the kill, the other Werewolves do not vote. Do note that at least one Wolfpack member has to vote for a kill, otherwise no kill is made at all.
- When choosing someone to kill at night, the Wolfpack often has to consider their target's importance for the village versus the risk that their target will be protected and/or watched by a Harlot. Usually, the most valuable targets for the Wolfpack are those with (important) roles who have stated their role publicly, and may even have been confirmed my others. The Wolfpack wants them dead before they can form a circle of trust, so they should kill them. But then again, these players are also usually the targets chosen by the village's defensive roles. For example, if a single Seer has come out during the day, it is very risky to try to kill them the next night. If there are multiple targets in the village, try to think: who would you protect as Protector/Huntsman (or watch as Harlot)? And then, kill (one of) the other(s).
- Apart from trying to kill the important village members before they can form a circle of trust, the Wolfpack can/should also try to become part of said circle of trust, by claiming roles themselves. There are several roles that the Wolfpack can fake, and a few things to consider when doing so. You have to think about whether the information that you produce can easily be discredited. For example, a Seer is an easy role to fake, but a Harlot is a very difficult one. The more difficult the role is to fake the more credible you are when you succeed, but the more likely you will fail. Another consideration is whether your visit pattern matches your alleged role's visiting pattern - if a Stalker or Harlot would see you visiting, does it match your role claim? Matching a visiting pattern with a role claim is generally easier for non-killer wolves, because they can be seen visiting players that do not die during the night.
- Wolfpack members can help each other by confirming each other with their alleged roles, but this is a risky play: if one of them is exposed, any of the people they have confirmed will now be suspicious as well. You can also use this to your advantage, by confirming village members with your alleged role. You could even discredit one of your fellow Werewolves, if you expect that you yourself may be exposed - the village may conclude from this that your ally is in fact a village member!
- As a fake role, you could first produce information that doesn't conflict with anyone else. For example: as a Seer, your first find a few village members. This gives you time to build trust; the people that you have confirmed as village may be inclined to believe you. Then later, at a crucial moment, you frame another player by disclosing incriminating information about them. Another strategy is to attack someone early with your role claim, or to counter-claim a role that would only be in the game once (like Protector or Mason Leader) - these aggressive moves may not be expected from a Wolfpack member, and may therefore pay off.
- As a rule, all genuine important village members will die sooner than later. Therefore, if you have claimed an important role and survive throughout the game, your credibility decreases by day: either you have been shapeshifted into or you were a wolf from the start! This is something you have to consider and must account for. Only the Wolfpack's Shapeshifter has an excellent way out of this, of course!
