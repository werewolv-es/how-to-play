# Bloodthirster

The Bloodthirster is a powerful addition to the Wolfpack. Each night that the Bloodthirster is alive and there are more than 4 members of the Wolfpack alive, the Wolfpack gains an extra kill.

## Role Type

- The Bloodthirster is seen as a member of the Wolfpack by the Seer.
- The Bloodthirster is not seen as a user of witchcraft by the Witch Hunter.
- The Bloodthirster is seen visiting by the Harlot/Stalker/Familiar only if they are the killing wolf.
- The Bloodthirster is seen as a killer by the Adjudicator.

## Notes

- Different wolves must take each of the available kills.
- The Bloodthirster may act as a killing wolf.
- Once the Wolfpack has fewer than 5 living wolves, the Bloodthirster is effectively a regular Werewolf.

## Tips

- For some general tips on how to play as a member of the Wolfpack, look at the corresponding section in the 'Factions' page.
