<h2>Items in werewolv.es</h2>

<p>Items were an unannounced, surprise feature in ext-300. They have appeared in a few games since, but are not always included in a setup.</p>

<p>You can only see the Items you carry during the night phase. A notification is given at the start of the night phase if you carry one or more Items. The Items appear in the village panel.</p>
<p>Items are either persistent or consumable. Consumable Items disappear from the game once they have been used.</p>
<p>Items are either active or passive. Active Items must be initiated by the Player that has control of them for them to work. An active Item can be used by clicking on it in the village panel.</p>
<p>Items and role abilities can be used the same night.</p>
<p>Items may also be passed to a Player during the night, by clicking on the Item in the village panel and clicking the icon arrow next to the name of the recipient. Passing an Item does not count as a visit.</p>
<p>Items which have an active ability cannot be passed and used on the same night.</p>
<p>Items such as the potions and other targeted items count as visits and can be seen by other roles.</p>
<p>Items may be stolen by roles such as a Thief, stolen by killing a player or stolen by using a Potion of Acquiescence. If your Items are stolen one, you will only find out the next night.</p>
<p>More information regarding specific items will be added to the guide in good time. If you have any other questions about them, ask on <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/xFHCsJ6" target="_blank">Discord</a> or on <a href="https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/werewolv.es" target="_blank">Arqade</a>.</p>
