<h2>Items in werewolv.es</h2>

<p>Items were an unannounced, surprise feature in ext-300. They have appeared in a few games since, but are not always included in a setup.</p>

<p>Items are either persistent or consumable. Consumable items disappear from the game once they have been used.</p>
<p>Items are either active or passive. Active items must be initiated by the Player that has control of them for them to work.</p>
<p>Passive and Consumable items such as Steel Armour or a Wolf Pelt will offer automatic protection from a single attack, but will be consumed and lost once an attack is blocked.</p>
<p>Items may be stolen by roles such as a thief, stolen by killing a player or stolen by using a Potion of Acquiescence.</p>
<p>Items may also be passed to a player during the night.</p>
<p>Items such as the potions and other targeted items count as visits and can be seen by other roles.</p>
<p>More information regarding specific items will be added to the guide in good time. If you have any other questions about them, ask on <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/xFHCsJ6" target="_blank">Discord</a> or on <a href="https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/werewolv.es" target="_blank">Arqade</a>.</p>
