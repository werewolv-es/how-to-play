<h2>The Harpy</h2>

<p>The Harpy is a member of the Coven who can manipulate voting outcomes. They have the abilities <strong>Silence</strong> and <strong>Shroud</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Silence</strong> causes the vote of the target player to carry no weight (like a Puppet).</p>
<p><strong>Shroud</strong> causes the votes cast <em>against</em> the target player to carry no weight. They will not be lynched even if they have the highest total.</p>
<p>Both abilities may be cast on the same night. Both abilities are available every night. Silence and Shroud targets receive the same cryptic message in the morning.</p>

<h3>Tips for playing Harpy</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Silence players who are likely to vote against you if you are in a tight spot, or use it to frame someone as a Puppet when a lynch doesn't go through.</li>
    <li>Shroud a fellow Coven who has been caught out to save them for another night, or use it to stop an obvious lynch - and watch the second lynch choice go to the grave.</li>
    <li>Although Silence is the more offensive ability and Shroud defensive, you are not restricted on who you can target with either (friend or foe).</li>
    <li>Consider faking a visting role as you can visit both the living and the dead. But beware - the cryptic message your target sees may give you away!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes on the Harpy</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Both abilities count as a visit, and are visible to Stalkers/Harlots.</li>
    <li>You cannot visit the same player on consecutive nights (this includes Shrouding one night, and Silencing the next, for example.</li>
    <li>If you target a player in the grave on the night they are revived, the shroud or silence effect carries into the land of the living.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Role Text</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Silence and shroud targets receive this message in the morning:</strong> You had strange dreams in the night, they have shaken your faith in democracy.</li>
</ul>
