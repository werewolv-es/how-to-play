<h2>Courtesan</h2>

<p>The Courtesan is a member of the Village. Each night they may visit a single living player and block them from using their ability at night. In the morning the target recieves a message indicating they have been blocked.</p>

<h3>Tips for playing Courtesan</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The Courtesan appears and acts very much like the Direwolf. It can be hard for the village to tell them apart.</li>
    <li>Choose your targets carefully - you don't want to accidentally block a village role.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes on the Courtesan</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The Courtesan appears as a villager to the seer and is not a witchcraft user.</li>
    <li>The Courtesan is seen visiting by intel roles.</li>
    <li>The Courtesan cannot block a Succubus, Djinn, Vampire or Vampire Master. They may block a Sleepwalker and Insomniac, even though these roles may not even be aware that they had a special ability at all.</li>
    <li>The Courtesan can be redirected by a Succubus.</li>
    <li>If the target of the Courtesan's block used their ability, then it will be as if it was not used. (This means that limited-use abilities are not depleted if they are activated but blocked and roles that normally can not target the same player twice will be able to retarget their attempted target.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Role Text</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The target of the courtesan receives a meassage in the morning: <strong>"You were role-blocked last night, your night action did not take place."</strong> - even if they did not use their ability, or did not have an ability to be blocked.</li>
</ul>
