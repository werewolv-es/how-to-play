<h2>Inquisition Leader</h2>

<p>The Illuminati Leader is a villager with the ability to recruit other players into the Inquisition. The Illuminati are sworn against all forms of Witchcraft and wish to see all users of Witchcraft (good and evil) eradicated.</p>

<h3>Role Type</h3>
<ul>
     <li>The Inquisition Leader is seen as member of the village by the Seer.</li>
     <li>The Inquisition Leader is not seen as a user of witchcraft by the Witch Hunter.</li>
     <li>The Inquisition Leader is seen visiting by the Harlot/Stalker/Familiar.</li>
 </ul>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The Inquisition Leader is limited to 2 recruits per game.</li>
    <li>If the Inquisition Leader tries to recruit a Werewolf or a Vampire, they are killed.</li>
    <li>The Illuminati Leader is not able to recruit any player who already has a night-faction (Familiar, Coven member, Mason, Illuminati Member) or any user of Witchcraft but will not be killed if they try. This failed recruit does not count towards the ability use limit.</li>
    <li>The recruited villager retains their original ability.</li>
    <li>The recruited villager is notified that they have been recruited in the morning and who recruited them, but not who any other Inquisition may be.</li>
    <li>The Inquisition Leader gets a notification if a succesful recruit has been made. No notification is given if the recruit is unsuccesful, but in that case the Inquisition Leader can draw their own conclusion...</li>
    <li>If a player is targeted by multiple Village sub-factions (Masons, Illuminati, Inquisition) then the recruit will fail for all of them.</li>
    <li>The Inquisition can not win if there are any witchcraft users still alive at the end of the game</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tips for playing Inquisition Leader</h3>
<ul>
    <li>An Inquisition Leader is very effective in creating a team of village members that verify each other. It also allows a recruited village member to share their valuable information with the village through another, so without exposing themselves.</li>
    <li>It is usually wise to not recruit the first night; you can give yourself some time to first assess the village. Don't wait too long with your (first) recruit though!</li>
    <li>It depends on the setup whether it is wise to expose yourself before making your recruit. In case you die, the village may at least use the information that you tried to recruit a specific person. But it wouldn't be wise if you suspect there is no one to protect you in the first place, and the presence of Coven members makes your task more difficult as well (a Succubus may redirect you, for example).</li>
    <li>You may, as Inquisition, agree on certain code words with which you can verify each other the following day, by stating them in the village day chat. This helps protect the Inquisition against Djinn-swaps and Shapeshifts, for example.</li>
