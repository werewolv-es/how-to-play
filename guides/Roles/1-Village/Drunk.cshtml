<h2>Drunk</h2>

<p>The Drunk is a neutral player who does not currently know their actual role.</p>

<h3>Notes on the Drunk</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Until such time as the Drunk sobers up they count as a member of the Village when evaluating the win-conditions for the other factions.</li>
    <li>There is no fixed time as to when the Drunk sobers up, but when they do they fully-embrace their new role and faction and win/lose as that faction.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tips for playing Drunk</h3>
<ul>
    <li>As there is no fixed-time for when the Drunk will sober up, nor any guarantee as to which faction/role they sober up into you can use this to your advantage if you sober up into a non-Village faction.</li>
</ul>
