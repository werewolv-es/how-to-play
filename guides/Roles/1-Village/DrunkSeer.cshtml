<h3>Drunk Seer</h3>

<p>The Drunk Seer works like a normal <a href="https://werewolv.es/guides/roles/Seer">Seer</a>, however, they have a chance to have one too many drinks, forgetting what they saw the previous night.</p>
<p>Whether the Drunk Seer forgets their check or not depends on drawing a drunk/sober result from a randomised bag. 
    The bag contains two drunk results and three sober results. Once a result is drawn, it not replaced. Meaning that if you are drunk on the first two nights, you are guaranteed to get a successful check on the third. 
    The bag is reshuffled when there is only one item remaining in it - so <pre>DRUNK, DRUNK, SOBER, SOBER, DRUNK</pre> is an entirely possible sequence of results.</p>
