<h2>Huntsman</h2>

<p>The Huntsman is a brave villager who risks their own life in protecting other village members. At night, the Huntsman can guard a player of their choosing. If that person is attacked by the Wolfpack, the Huntsman and the killing wolf will die.</p>

<h3>Role Type</h3>
<ul>
     <li>The Huntsman is seen as member of the village by the Seer.</li>
     <li>The Huntsman is not seen as a user of witchcraft.</li>
     <li>The Huntsman is seen visiting by the Harlot/Stalker/Familiar.</li>
     <li>The Huntsman is seen as a killer by the Adjudicator.</li>
 </ul>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The Huntsman cannot protect the last player that they successfully protected or attempted to protect.</li>
    <li>The Huntsman cannot protect themselves (but the Protector can).</li>
    <li>If the Protector and Huntsman guard the same target and the wolves attack, the Huntsman's ability triggers first. So the Huntsman and killing wolf will still die.</li>
    <li>If the Huntsman guards a player attacked by night immune killer, such as a Vampire, the Huntsman will die in the target's place.</li>
    <li>A Huntsman cannot protect against a Militia's, Witch Hunter's, Zealot's, Witch's, or Necromancer's killing abilities.</li>
    <li>If a Huntsman is recruited by a Vampire (Master) the same night they guard somebody against a wolf's attack, that wolf dies but the Huntsman survives, becoming a Familiar as usual.</li>
    <li>If two wolves try to attack a target guarded by the Huntsman (e.g. the wolves have a Bloodthirster), both wolves die, along with any other Huntsman-vulnerable attackers from other factions. The Huntsman also protects against an additional Vampire attack, but the Vampire is not killed by the confrontation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tips for playing Huntsman</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The Huntsman is most effective when they remain anonymous, so that they can protect important (exposed) village members without being exposed themselves.</li>
    <li>It is usually wise to not reveal who you protected the most recent night, since any evil faction member now knows whom you cannot protect the upcoming night.</li>
    <li>The Huntsman becomes increasingly durable when they combine with a Protector and/or Harlot, possibly in combination with an intel role like a Seer. The Huntsman, Protector, and Harlot can protect/watch each other and/or the exposed village roles, so that no Werewolf/Vampire would attempt to kill them. The village often uses this principle even if they cannot guarantee everyone's safety, i.e. when the amount of people that require protection exceeds the amount of defensive roles. It will still be too risky for Werewolves/Vampire to attack anyone in this group.</li>
    <li>As seen from the previous example, even the sheer possibility of a Huntsman protecting somebody is enough to deter would-be attackers. If you wish to take a risk, you may even protect another person than the person you were intended/declared to protect, so that the next night - when the evil factions think they're safe - you will be right there!</li>
    <li>Try to think like the Wolfpack/Vampire, who would you kill if you were trying to hurt the village? Protect that person!</li>
</ul>
