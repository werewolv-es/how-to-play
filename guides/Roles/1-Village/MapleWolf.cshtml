<h3>Notes on the Maple Wolf</h3>
<ul>

    <li>The Maple Wolf is unable to speak with other Werewolves at night, or see their messages</li>
    <li>The Maple Wolf can choose to either kill or not to kill each night - but must make a successful kill at least every 3 nights or they will starve to death on the 4th night.</li>
    <li>The Maple Wolf can kill other Werewolves, Coven and Undead members, but cannot kill roles with night-immunity.</li>
    <li>Protective roles such as the Protector, Shaman, and Huntsman can stop the Maple Wolf kill as normal.</li>
    <li>The Huntsman can not differentiate a Maple Wolf from a regular Werewolf and will kill the Maple Wolf and themselves as they would with a Werewolf kill.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Tips for playing Maple Wolf</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The village will be naturally suspicious of any claimed Maple Wolves as they can not normally differentiate them from regular wolves.</li>
    <li>Getting recruited into one of the Village-aligned sub-factions will allow you to prove yourself as village-aligned</li>
    <li>You must make a successful kill every 3 nights, so try not to leave your killing too long as a protective role can make you go hungry for a night if they protect your target.</li>
</ul>
