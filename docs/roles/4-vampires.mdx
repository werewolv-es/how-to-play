## The Vampires

Vampires are powerful, evil characters seeking to kill all other
factions. This 'faction' is unique in the sense that multiple Vampires
in the same game never work together, but oppose each other, actually
forming different factions. A team formed by a single Vampire and their
Familiar(s) is called a 'basement'. There are two types of roles who
start in this faction: the Vampire and the Vampire Master (the latter
being a stronger version of the former). Both roles are extremely
resillient: they are immune to most abilities. They can kill every
night. Both roles also have the ability to recruit one or more Familiars
(Vampire can recruit only one, Vampire Master up to three). A player
that is recruited as Familiar becomes a servant to the recruiting
Vampire (Master).

### Tips for playing as one of the Vampires

  - Vampires cannot be killed during the night, but they are vulnerable
    during the day. If the village decides to lynch them (because a Seer
    checked the Vampire, a Stalker/Harlot saw the Vampire visiting
    somebody that died, or for any other reason), it would be game over
    for the Vampire. This is why any Vampire should make sure that they
    have a Familiar, and that this Familiar is kept safe. The Familiar
    makes it possible for the Vampire to return to the game, once their
    original body is killed.
  - Choosing the right Familiar is an important task for a Vampire, and
    a difficult one as well. Your Familiar should be somebody who has
    some status in the village and wouldn't get lynched. But on the
    other hand, you also want to choose somebody that wouldn't be killed
    by other evil factions, if they are in the game.
  - Since a Vampire is reborn in their Familiar's body, you have to take
    care that people do not notice the change of player. This means that
    you have to be conscious of your typing style from the start of the
    game, and maybe change things so that your typing style matches that
    of the Familiar. Other things that people notice are activity times
    and voting patterns. Try to resemble the person you are reborn into
    as much as possible.
  - For more Tips, specified to the type of Vampire you're playing,
    simply look at the specific role page (and the Familiar page as
    well).
