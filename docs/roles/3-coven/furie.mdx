## Furie

The Furie is a member of the Coven who blends offense and defense. Their
night ability is based on whether or not the village lynches that day.

If the village has lynched a player during the day, the Furie's visit
that night will *protect*.

If the village did not lynch a player during the day, the Furie's visit
that night will *kill*.

### Role Type

  - The Furie is seen as a member of the Coven by the Seer.
  - The Furie is seen as a user of witchcraft.
  - The Furie is seen visiting by the Harlot/Stalker/Familiar.
  - The Furie is seen as a killer by the Adjudicator.

### Notes on the Furie

  - The Furie does not receive a power on night 1.
  - The Furie cannot visit themselves.
  - The protection ability is the same as the village Protector (see
    Protector page for interactions with other roles).
  - The kill ability is the same as a regular Werewolf (see Werewolf
    page for interactions with other roles).
  - The protect ability **can** be used on the same target two nights in
    a row.
  - The kill ability can be blocked by a Protector, Shaman or Huntsman
    (the last of which will kill you).

### Tips for playing Furie

  - Consider claiming the role of Protector, Witch Hunter or Militia -
    after all you have some of those abilities (sometimes).
  - Kill your enemies, protect your friends, or protect your enemies to
    avoid suspicion.
  - You are at the mercy of whether or not a lynch happens, so try to
    guide the village towards the outcome you need to get the power you
    want that night.
  - Combine with Harpy for interesting results.

### Role Text

One of two messages appears at night time to indicate which ability is
active:

  - **"You are pleased by the lynch. Tonight you will protect the player
    you choose to visit."** appears if protect is active.
  - **"The lack of death angers you. Tonight you will kill the player
    you choose to visit."** appears if kill is active.
