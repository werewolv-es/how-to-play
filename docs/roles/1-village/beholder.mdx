## Beholder

Once per night, the Beholder can select a player. If they select an
intel role, they will see whatever their target saw, and get a report in
the morning. There are a few exceptions to this rule, and some reports
are slightly changed.

### Role Type

  - The Beholder is seen as member of the village by the Seer.
  - The Beholder is seen as a user of witchcraft.
  - The Beholder is seen visiting by the Harlot/Stalker/Familiar.
  - The Beholder is not seen as a killer by the Adjudicator.

### Notes

  - The Beholder only gets reports from: the Gravedigger, Stalker,
    Harlot, Familiar, Seer, Bloodhound, Tarot Reader, and Witch Hunter.
    The Beholder does not get any report/notification if the target does
    not use their ability, or if their target has been role-blocked.
  - Stalkers and Familiars receive the same morning report.
  - The Bloodhound's report for the Beholder is changed so that it is
    identical to the Seer's report (only seeing alignment).
  - The Beholder will not see notifications from non-intel roles (e.g.
    Protector or Huntsman).

### Tips for playing Beholder

  - The Beholder is a valuable supportive role in games with intel
    roles. You can verify and discredit people who claim to have such a
    role.
  - It may be valuable to target somebody who you suspect/know has a
    role and/or is likely to die that night. If they die, you can at
    least pass on their information\!
  - You have to consider what the right time is for you to speak up. You
    do not want to expose roles unnecessarily (early). On the other
    hand, you may be able to form a team of cleared village roles so
    that they can work together whilst being protected.
