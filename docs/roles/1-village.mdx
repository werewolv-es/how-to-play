## The Village

The majority of the players in any game are almost always members of the
village. They are the uninformed majority: as a rule, each member of the
village begins the game not knowing who to trust. As the game
progresses, members of the village must work out who is lying to them
and who is genuine. This is different for the enemies of the village:
members of other factions know from the start who their allies are. This
is the initial disadvantage of the village, and the crucial mechanism on
which the whole game is based\!

The village has access to many powerful roles, which excel in different
aspects of the game. The village has roles that can defend other
players, gather information, and/or kill others players. Unless the role
list is given at the start of the game, the village does not know which
roles are in the game - generally, only a portion of the total amount of
village roles is present in the game. The village members, especially
those with special abilities, become increasingly effective the more
they work together. A village in which the important members know to
trust each other and work together effectively is nearly unstoppable by
any other faction. It is therefore crucial that the village members work
on finding their allies before their enemies can kill them and/or
cunningly infiltrate their ranks\!

### Tips for playing as Village

  - The village needs to gather information to become victorious. It is
    not enough to let the intel roles gather information at night and
    wait for them. The day phase is a crucial moment for the village to
    make progress: talk to people, assess whom they (dis)trust and why,
    what (kind of) role they have, what they think is a good strategy
    for the game in terms of lynching and role reveals, etc.
  - While gaining information is crucial, any public information will
    always be used the evil factions as well. Every village member has
    to assess who benefits most from revealing a certain piece of
    information. This could be revealing something about your own role
    to the village or pressuring another player to reveal something
    about their role. The latter may force an enemy of the village to
    make a (false) claim about their identity, thereby reducing the room
    they have to make claims later on. In addition, the player's story
    can be verified to see whether they were lying or not. On the other
    hand, forcing another player to reveal their role may expose an
    important village member to the evil factions. The difficulty is, of
    course, that you're not absolutely beforehand whether it was wise to
    force another player to reveal (something about) their identity.
    This dilemma is an important topic in almost every village
    discussion, especially in closed setups.
  - It would be ideal if all village members would simultaneously be
    online and state their role right after each other - this would give
    evil factions no chance to strategize their false claims and adapt
    conveniently to whatever village members claim about their
    identities. Unfortunately for the village, though, this is not
    possible in the online game - enemies of the village may be online
    but hide in silence, only speaking if it is convenient and when they
    have a plan. There is not much you can do against this, because
    players live in different timezones and may be available on
    different times of the day due to their personal schedules, so they
    will have a valid reason to be absent at any given time (of course,
    sudden disappearances by people can be rightfully questioned). This
    is a reason why a plan which relies on (almost) all players to
    participate in simultaneously is doomed to fail in most cases. Only
    when a few players are left alive, such a plan might work...
  - Honesty is an important trait of the village member. Even if you are
    wrongfully accused, framed, or victimized in some other way, you
    have at least told the village your rightful account of the game.
    Once it is discovered that you are in fact a village member and/or
    that the people framing you are non-village members, whatever you
    have said can be accepted as truthful from that moment onwards.
  - Some village members do use lies to find enemies. While the reward
    may be great if the plan is succesful, lying may also backfire\!
    What if you are killed before you could explain what you were doing,
    for example? If people find out that you're not telling the truth
    they may also hold that against you, your enemies included. This is
    why using lies as village members should usually only be done if you
    have some failsafes installed. For example, Mason members might use
    lies more easily than other village members, because they can always
    vouch for each other...
