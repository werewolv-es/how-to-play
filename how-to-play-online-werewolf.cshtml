<h2>How to Play</h2>
<h3>The basics</h3>
<p>werewolv.es has two basic game modes. 24 hour games and speed rounds. The 24 hour games have 12-hour day and night cycles. In speed rounds a day and night only take five to ten minutes, usually. The 24 hour games are played continuously - there is usually one ongoing, and one where you can sign up, at any moment. The speed games are occasionally hosted in the weekend. Whichever mode is used, victory conditions and basic play remains the same: The village is trying to work out who are killing them during the night, and the evil factions are trying to stay hidden until they have whittled down the numbers of the village. The evil factions are: the Werewolves, the Coven, and the Vampire - each game includes at least one, and possibly multiple, of these factions. The game is divided into two basic phases, day and night.</p>
<h3>Night Phase</h3>
<p>During the night phase, members of evil factions can talk to their allies in secret and choose their victim(s). This is the time that special characters can decide how to use their unique ability. When night is over, abilities and kills are resolved and day begins.</p>
<h3>Day Phase</h3>
<p>The daytime is where most of the game of werewolv.es actually takes place. The village must talk amongst itself and piece together whatever scraps of information they may have been able to find in order to work out who the enemies are. Once the village has a suspicion, they are able to democratically lynch someone. Once they have lynched all evils, they win.</p>
<h3>Lynching</h3>
<p>In a 24 hour game, votes are cast throughout the day and when night falls, the player with the most votes is lynched by the village. If there is a tie, nobody is lynched. In exceptional cases, the mode is set to enforced lynch: a player is selected at random from those with the highest number of votes. If no one has any votes, this could result in ANYONE being lynched randomly.</p>
