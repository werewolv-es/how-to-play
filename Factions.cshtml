<h2>Factions</h2>

<p>werewolv.es is a team game, which pits the Village against one or more smaller evil factions. A description of all factions and their characteristic strengths/weaknesses will be given below. If you are playing as a certain faction for the first time, it is wise to read the Tips & Considerations for this faction. It may also be helpful to read these sections for any faction(s) that you're playing against, so you know better what your enemy is doing.</p>

<h3>The Village</h3>

<p>The majority of the players in any game are almost always members of the village. They are the uninformed majority: as a rule, each member of the village begins the game not knowing who to trust. As the game progresses, members of the village must work out who is lying to them and who is genuine. This is different for the enemies of the village: members of other factions know from the start who their allies are. This is the initial disadvantage of the village, and the crucial mechanism on which the whole game is based!</p>
<p>The village has access to many powerful roles, which excel in different aspects of the game. The village has roles that can defend other players, gather information, and/or kill others players. Unless the role list is given at the start of the game, the village does not know which roles are in the game - generally, only a portion of the total amount of village roles is present in the game. The village members, especially those with special abilities, become increasingly effective the more they work together. A village in which the important members know to trust each other and work together effectively is nearly unstoppable by any other faction. It is therefore crucial that the village members work on finding their allies before their enemies can kill them and/or cunningly infiltrate their ranks!</p> 

<h3>Tips & Considerations for playing as Village</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The village needs to gather information to become victorious. It is not enough to let the intel roles gather information at night and wait for them. The day phase is a crucial moment for the village to make progress: talk to people, assess whom they (dis)trust and why, what (kind of) role they have,  what they think is a good strategy for the game in terms of lynching and role reveals, etc.</li>
    <li>While gaining information is crucial, any public information will always be used the evil factions as well. Every village member has to assess who benefits most from revealing a certain piece of information. This could be revealing something about your own role to the village or pressuring another player to reveal something about their role. The latter may force an enemy of the village to make a (false) claim about their identity, thereby reducing the room they have to make claims later on. In addition, the player's story can be verified to see whether they were lying or not. On the other hand, forcing another player to reveal their role may expose an important village member to the evil factions. The difficulty is, of course, that you're not absolutely beforehand whether it was wise to force another player to reveal (something about) their identity. This dilemma is an important topic in almost every village discussion, especially in closed setups.</li>
    <li>It would be ideal if all village members would simultaneously be online and state their role right after each other - this would give evil factions no chance to strategize their false claims and adapt conveniently to whatever village members claim about their identities. Unfortunately for the village, though, this is not possible in the online game - enemies of the village may be online but hide in silence, only speaking if it is convenient and when they have a plan. There is not much you can do against this, because players live in different timezones and may be available on different times of the day due to their personal schedules, so they will have a valid reason to be absent at any given time (of course, sudden disappearances by people can be rightfully questioned). This is a reason why a plan which relies on (almost) all players to participate in simultaneously is doomed to fail in most cases. Only when a few players are left alive, such a plan might work...</li>
    <li>Honesty is an important trait of the village member. Even if you are wrongfully accused, framed, or victimized in some other way, you have at least told the village your rightful account of the game. Once it is discovered that you are in fact a village member and/or that the people framing you are non-village members, whatever you have said can be accepted as truthful from that moment onwards.</li> 
    <li>Some village members do use lies to find enemies. While the reward may be great if the plan is succesful, lying may also backfire! What if you are killed before you could explain what you were doing, for example? If people find out that you're not telling the truth they may also hold that against you, your enemies included. This is why using lies as village members should usually only be done if you have some failsafes installed. For example, Mason members might use lies more easily than other village members, because they can always vouch for each other...</li>
<\ul>

<h3>The Wolfpack</h3>

<p>The Wolfpack is the standard enemy of the village. This is a group of Werewolves, a secret society within the village. During the day they appear to be village members, but at night their true identity is revealed - the Wolfpack will hunt and kill village members, and also use other abilities to harm the village and to further their own agenda. The Werewolves win if during the day no other evil faction members are alive and there are as many Wolfpack members left as there are village members.</p>
<p>All living Wolfpack members have the ability to talk with each other in secret during the night. This is the moment when the Werewolves together decide how to use their abilities and who they should kill. There is a basic distinction between two sorts of Wolfpack members: those that have the ability to kill, and those that have other abilities. All wolves that have the ability to kill can vote for another player, similarly to how lynch votes work during the day. If one player has a majority of kill votes, one of the Werewolves that has voted for this player will become the 'killing wolf'. The killing wolf is selected at random from this group of Werewolves. The killing wolf (alone) ventures out that night to kill the target - only this Werewolf will be seen visiting the target. If there are two or more players that have the most votes by killing Wolfpack members, and thus the votes are tied, one of these players is selected at random as the Wolfpack's victim for the night. A killing wolf is randomly selected from the Werewolves who have voted for this target.</p>
<p>In addition to Werewolves that can kill at night, the Wolfpack has other roles at their disposal. Players with these roles are free to use their abilities in a way that benefits the Wolfpack the most. These Werewolves are not a part of the kill-voting system. Note that if, at any given night, there are no longer any Werewolves with the ability to kill, one of the non-killing Wolfpack members becomes a regular Werewolf, with the ability to kill.</p>

<h3>Tips & Considerations for playing as the Wolfpack</h3>
<ul>
    <li>In order to control exactly who is killed and who runs the risk of being seen visited, the Wolfpack often elects a single member of their pack to make the kill for that night. They are the only one to vote for the kill, the other Werewolves do not vote. Do note that at least one Wolfpack member has to vote for a kill, otherwise no kill is made at all.</li>
    <li>When choosing someone to kill at night, the Wolfpack often has to consider their target's importance for the village versus the risk that their target will be protected and/or watched by a Harlot. Usually, the most valuable targets for the Wolfpack are those with (important) roles who have stated their role publicly, and may even have been confirmed my others. The Wolfpack wants them dead before they can form a circle of trust, so they should kill them. But then again, these players are also usually the targets chosen by the village's defensive roles. For example, if a single Seer has come out during the day, it is very risky to try to kill them the next night. If there are multiple targets in the village, try to think: who would you protect as Protector/Huntsman (or watch as Harlot)? And then, kill (one of) the other(s).</li>
    <li>Apart from trying to kill the important village members before they can form a circle of trust, the Wolfpack can/should also try to become part of said circle of trust, by claiming roles themselves. There are several roles that the Wolfpack can fake, and a few things to consider when doing so. You have to think about whether the information that you produce can easily be discredited. For example, a Seer is an easy role to fake, but a Harlot is a very difficult one. The more difficult the role is to fake the more credible you are when you succeed, but the more likely you will fail. Another consideration is whether your visit pattern matches your alleged role's visiting pattern - if a Stalker or Harlot would see you visiting, does it match your role claim? Matching a visiting pattern with a role claim is generally easier for non-killer wolves, because they can be seen visiting players that do not die during the night.<li>
    <li>Wolfpack members can help each other by confirming each other with their alleged roles, but this is a risky play: if one of them is exposed, any of the people they have confirmed will now be suspicious as well. You can also use this to your advantage, by confirming village members with your alleged role. You could even discredit one of your fellow Werewolves, if you expect that you yourself may be exposed - the village may conclude from this that your ally is in fact a village member!</li>
    <li>As a fake role, you could first produce information that doesn't conflict with anyone else. For example: as a Seer, your first find a few village members. This gives you time to build trust; the people that you have confirmed as village may be inclined to believe you. Then later, at a crucial moment, you frame another player by disclosing incriminating information about them. Another strategy is to attack someone early with your role claim, or to counter-claim a role that would only be in the game once (like Protector or Mason Leader) - these aggressive moves may not be expected from a Wolfpack member, and may therefore pay off.</li>
    <li>As a rule, all genuine important village members will die sooner than later. Therefore, if you have claimed an important role and survive throughout the game, your credibility decreases by day: either you have been shapeshifted into or you were a wolf from the start! This is something you have to consider and must account for. Only the Wolfpack's Shapeshifter has an excellent way out of this, of course!</li>   
</ul>

<h3>The Coven</h3>

<p>The Coven is a third party who specialises in creating chaos and confusion amongst the village members. They have limited kill power and rely on manipulation to win the game. Games that include the Coven usually have a Wolfpack and/or a Vampire present as well, in order to have a consistent source of kills during the night.</p>
<p>For the Coven to win, they need to eliminate all members of other evil factions, and their numbers should equal those of the remaining village members.</p>

<h3>Tips & Considerations for playing as Coven</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The Coven needs another evil faction, with killing power, to be present in the game. This is a Wolfpack and/or a Vampire. The Coven should focus on finding out who the other evil faction members are, and allow them to live just long enough so that they can kill plenty of village members. Then, once the village's numbers have dwindled enough, the Coven should get rid of the Wolfpack/Vampire. For the Coven to succeed, they should have a more trusted position in the village during the stage that they are getting rid of the Wolfpack/Vampire (in order to convince the village to steer the lynch votes in the right direction), but should not be exposed/attacked during the earlier stages of the game.</li>
    <li>The Coven and the Wolfpack/Vampire have a common enemy: the village. This shared interest is something that may steer them in working together, for a limited amount of time. Evils from different factions may help each other out by 'confirming' each other with their alleged roles. It is also the common interest of the evil factions to tell a lie about certain events that have taken place, as it may discredit actual village members and/or create space for the evil factions to operate freely. This also means that, if you see a non-Coven member assisting you in the creation of some lie, you have a strong indication that they are not a village member. Note that they may now have the same information about you!</li>
    <li>The Coven's main power is to create ambiguity in as many aspects of the game as possible; about the identities of players, about how certain events such as deaths and revives can be explained, etc. The Coven can thrive better if the village has no basis of certain knowledge to operate on.</li>
    <li>Members of the Coven should usually be aware of their typing style and activity pattern, at least as long there is a Djinn in the game. You could be swapped with another player, or with a Puppet, and to conceal this Djinn-swap you should be able to copy the other's typing style and activity pattern as well as possible.</li>
    <li>The Coven has limited protection against a Wolfpack and/or a Vampire. This is why they shouldn't attract too much attention from these factions, especially at the start of the game. Ideally, the village and the evil killing factions are concerned with fighting each other, allowing the Coven to survive. Their vulnerability the Coven should take into account when making role claims. For example: claiming an important role that a Wolfpack wants dead, especially early in the game, is risky - you may be inspected/attacked from all sides.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Vampire</h3>

<p>The Vampire is different from the other factions because they are on their own (they may recruit a single ally in the game), so describing this faction is the same as describing the Vampire as role. Therefore, please see the Vampire's (and the Familiar's) role description for more information and for tips on how to play them.</p>
