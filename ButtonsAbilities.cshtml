<h2>Basics</h2>

<h3>Navigation</h3>

<p>During any game, there are 3 icons that will help you do anything you want to, located on the top bar. These are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A symbol of a person with an 'i' next to it: pressing this will make the identity panel appear or disappear. You can find essential information about your role, objectives, and abilities, on this side panel.</li>
  <li>A symbol of a group (of 3 people), with a number next to it: pressing this will make the village panel appear or disappear. Here you can see which players are still alive, and which players are dead (in the Graveyard). A button may also be visible next to the names of players, and during the day you will also see a number (more on this later). The number next to the icon tells you how many players are alive at that moment.</li>
  <li>A symbol of a calendar, with a number next to it: pressing this will open the calendar panel, and allow you to access the chat archive. This way, you can look back at any previous days and read back the chat. Nights and days with the same number are grouped together under the same day. The number next to the icon tells you which day (or corresponding night) it is at the current moment.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Using abilities</h3>

<p>On this website, all actions are carried out with the use of buttons. 
The only exception to this is typing during the day (and during the night, in specific cases), which is done by simply typing a message in the bottom bar.
All buttons are used in the village panel. During the day, you will see a 'Vote' button next to other players' names. 
Pressing it will make you cast a vote on that player, thereby broadcasting a message to the rest of the village to inform them of your (changed) vote.
The number next to a player tells you how many people have voted for that person. By holding your mouse over the number, you are informed which players have cast these votes.</p>
During the night, many roles use their special abilities. You will find buttons next to players' names just as during the day. 
You can change your ability's target by simply pressing the button next to another player.</p>

<p><strong>BEWARE: most abilities cannot be cancelled, once you've chosen to use them at night, so consider whether you really want to use them!</strong></p>

<p>Note that there are some appearances of buttons in places where you don't expect them, and this usually also means that the buttons are not functional. 
You may see a 'Vote' button next to your own character, for example, or you may see your ability buttons appear even when you're dead. 
<em>Don't worry:</em> nothing will happen when you push them!</p>
